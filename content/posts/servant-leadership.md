I've been interviewing for a few engineering manager roles and I've been
thinking a lot more about the idea of servant leadership lately. I get that
the idea is beginning to gain some traction, but I wonder if "servant" and
"leadership" are really words that can go together.

I do think the concept itself is great, of course - we really don't have
enough leaders who think their role is to serve their team members instead of
commanding them. That's admirable, and certainly can use more acceptance among
leaders.

But is that really their primary role? Let's face it - the leader owes
their primary allegiance to the organization they're part of, not individual
team members. There might come a time the leader needs to take the difficult
decision of letting a team member go, for any number of reasons. Does the word
"servant leader" really sound honest here?

Being a leader means sooner or later they have to take difficult decisions,
which might not immediately seem palatable to the team. They'll have to read the
riot act eventually to tide the organization over a difficult phase that's not
necessarily the fault of the team itself. Can servants really displease their
masters and survive long?

Don't get me wrong, I like all the ideas that encompass the typical servant
leadership vocabulary - empathy, humility, mentorship, etc. But I think it's a
bit disingenuous to call yourself a "servant" when you have the authority
to fire someone if they fail to perform to your expectations.

Perhaps calling it "empathic leadership" is enough. The idea being that while a
leader will certainly do everything in their power to fix the issues affecting
your performance and satisfaction at the job, they are certainly not beholden
to your expectations and are quite likely to take decisions that you might not
personally agree with, in the interests of the organization they serve. I think
that's a much more honest picture of a good leader.
